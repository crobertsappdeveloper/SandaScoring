# SandaScoring
Sport scoring app for Sanda/Sanshou Chinese Boxing for when two opponents are sparring buttons are pressed to increase or decrease points.

This is as per the rules of Sanda where there is a +1, +2 or +3 point and there is also a foul point which means -1 point. Disqualification isn't on the app as I didn't feel the need to put this on there.
